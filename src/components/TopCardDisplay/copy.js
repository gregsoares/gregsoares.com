        As an 8-year-old, instantly connecting with people across the globe was mind-blowing. The
        real-time chat of mIRC gave me an immediate look at the world. I was instantly hooked.

        This digital playground quickly pulled me into the world of scripting, networking, and
        ethical hacking. Being self-taught meant I was constantly making — and, more often, breaking
        — things, which forced me to learn and enjoy troubleshooting and debugging.

        IRC scripting first showed me the power of programming—the ability to identify and solve
        issues, and even automate tasks like creating an admin bot.

        Networking was a natural evolution, as I became fascinated by how systems communicate and
        how the internet could be leveraged.

        Ultimately, writing code allows me to create solutions, improve processes, and automate
        tasks, while networking provides the essential understanding of the underlying systems where
        it all takes place.
